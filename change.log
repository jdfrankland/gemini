13th May 2008 - first release 
4th June 2008 - bug fix
25th June 2008 - changes to aid portability, include possibility of Be evap
	         for Hauser-Feshbach
4th July  2008 - fixed bug for nonstatistical decay
24th July 2008 - fixed monor bug in CTlBarDist and a more important bug in 
	         CNucleus affecting decay of low spin systems. Also forced 
	         decay of 8Be and other systems with unstable ground states.
12th Aug 2008 - modified selectJ in Nucleus so it does not need so many tries.
27th Oct 2008 - The extrapolation of asymmetric barrier for nuclei heavier than
	        194Hg was bad- gave too many imf for heavy systems - changed
	        Yrast.pp to give better results
	        Changed the function describing the fadeout of shell effects
	        from h(U) = 1.-exp(-gamma*U) given by Ignatyuk to 
	        h(U) = tanh(gamma*U) in LevelDensity.cpp
1st Feb 2009    Added a new function to CNucleus class which gives a point to 
	        the parent fragment - This was requested so that one see
	        if an imf was directly emitted or underwent sequential decay.
	        Important for determining temperatures from isotope ratios.
6th Feb 2009    Received complaints that GEMINI++ was crashing for events 
	        with very high spin above the value where the fission barrier 
	        vanishes. Although one shouldn't really run GEMINI++ for 
	        such cases, I modified CYrast::prepareAsyBarrier to give a
 	        better extrapolation to high spins and stopped GEMINI++ from
	        crashing.
6th Feb 2009    Based on work trying to fit fission probabilities in both 
	        fusion and spallation reactions, I have revised the default
	        parameters.
	
	        Now CNucleus::fissionScaling factor =1.00
	            CLevelDensity::af/an =1.04

	        Before CNucleus::fissionScaling factor =2.46
	               CLevelDensity::af/an =1.00
	
	        This set seems to work for fusion reaction with A<208 and 
	        all spallation reactions. For Fusion with A>208 we find
	        af/an=1.01-1.025 works better. Hopefully in the future I will
	        find a parameter set that works for both fusion and spallation
	        for the heavy systems
29 th Mar 2009  CNucleus::getVelocity correct a mistype
7th   May 2009  added an abort event option - at the moment events are only
	        aborted if the symmetric fission and the variance of the mass 
	        distribution from the systematics is negative. This occurs
	        very rarely and only for the fission of a very light nucleus.
	        The events is aborted and the decay of the compound nucleus 
	        is started again. three aborts for the same compound nucleus
	        terminates the program.
11th May 2009   modification to Scission.cpp to deal with cases where 
	        d2vdeta2 < 0 from original application of Rusanov systematics
	        of fission mass witdths. Also some more modifications of the 
	        abortEvent logic. Now after three tries to decay an event, 
	        if it is not possible, gemini does not abort, but the 
	        abortEvent is set to true. 
10Th June 2009  The Sierk routine has given negative moments of inertia for 
                exotic nuclei (Z=24, A=39). This messes up the getYrast 
	        routine. I have added a test to see if the moment of inertia
	        is negative and, if so, sets this to the spherical value
12th Aug 2009   Whoops! seems for asymmetric fission I wasn't giving 
	        the fragments any kinetic energy. fixed.
19tH Aug 2009   bug in getYrast fixed. Also problem found by Zhiqiang Chen
	        in Nucleus causing memory leaks has been corrected.
9th Oct  2009   fixed a bug in Nucleus.cpp for asymmetric fission
20th Oct 2009   There was a problem in TLBarDist for protons in the 
	        extrapolation of the transmission coefficents to 
	        high l-waves. This produced proton kinetic-energy 
	        distributions with a second "Coulomb barrier".
	        I have also modified the Yrast line for light systems to
	        give the correct alpha-particle kinetic energy spectra.
	        This modification can be turned off with CYrast::forseSierk().
30th Oct 2009   Davide Mancusi found a minor bug which rarely caused to 
	        progam to crash which we fixed. assocaited with geting the KE 
	        of an asymmetric Fission fragment.  
13th Nov 2009   added a printParameters function to CYrast	
23rd Dec 2009   added getLightDaughter and getHeavyDaughter functions
	        to nagivate through the binary tree structure containing
	        the decay history.
27Th Jan 2010   a)Davide Mancusi alerted me to the existance of negative times.
	        These were a result that the force8Be, force5Li and force5He
	        functions do not assign time and the notStatistical part
	        of binaryDecay also does not. For the latter I had to add a 
	        new column in evap.inp to read in the widths of the states
	        to determine the time.
	        b) Also added new default values of 
	               CLevelDensity::Jfade
		       CLevelDensity::aKappa
		       CLevelDensity::cKappa
	               CTlBarDist::width
	       c)Also made CLevelDensity::PrintParameters()
	       print out eFad and jFade.
	       d) For asymmetric fission, changed from asyFissionWidthZA()
	       to asyFissionWidth()
7th March 2010 A number of changes which speedup the code somewhat
	       In CMass - shell corrections are now stored, but deformations
	         are not.
	       In CNucleus - faster more inteligent sums over E* and J in 
	         the hauser Feshbach - new functions  S2Loop2, EkLoop2, S1Width
	         EkWidth
	       In CTlArray - new function prepare.
	       In CTlBarDist - new function prepare.

23rd Sept 2010 a)got rid of original, but unused  S2loop and EkLoop routines
	       and replaced them with S2Loop2, EkLoop2
	       b) the scission point logic for fission mass distributions 
	         didn't work for spalltion reactions, so I tried the 
	         saddle-point logic which works for both fusion and spallation.
	         You can switch bewteen them with teh bool variable
	         fissionMassScission. The saddle-point logic is the default.
	       c) introduced new static function setSolution. This can set
	          either of the two fission solutions obtained in the 
	          Mancusi,Charity,and Cugnon paper.
	       d) Introduced variable GINPUT to point to directories 
	          containing the directories tl and tbl with input files.
	          If not set it looks in the current directory. 
	          You can set it with the export command
17th Dec 2010   a) little inconsistancy with shell and pairing correction 
	           to fission barrier - only affected post fission part
	        b) added function getSumGammaEnergy() to give total energy 
	           removed by gamma rays
	        c) added function getTime() to give the time a fragment 
	           was created
10th Feb 2011    Zach Kohley found a bug in the fission-fragment angular 
	         distributions which I corrected.
15th Feb 2011   Thomas Ullrich found a bug with CRandom.Gaus. This would 
	        not have been a problem unless one used HF=0(not default)
8th Mar 2011    added #include <cstdlib> to CLeveldensity.h, my compiler
	        does it automatically, but Anne Caraley's doesn't
14th Mar 2011   For those going to very large excitation energy, made 
	        gemini++ swith automatically to our high-excitation 
	        energy prescription of fission at E/A > 3 MeV.  
	        (See PRC 82 (2010) 044610). Fission is also tuned off above 
	        6 MeV, as we get conceptual problems, i.e., 
	        most, or all, of the system mass is evaporated 
	        during the saddle to scission transition.  
	        The accuracy of the predictions at this excitation energy
                are not known, use at you own risk.	
	
15th Mar 2011   I included modifications by Thomas Ullrich, this makes
	        the class CMass a singleton. This helps the code compile
	        without error on more machines. Most linux users will not 
	        notice. 
21th Mar 2011   Modifed imf emission to strictly enforce energy conservation.
	        Added fluctuations to coulomb energy for imf emission.
26th Mar 2011   modified getSep() in Scission.cpp to avoid an infinite loop
2nd  Aug 2011    Big changes to evaporation options with possible big
	        increases in speed.
                The Default option is calculate the evapation decay width
	        from either the Hauser-Feshbach or Weisskopf formalisms,
                depending on ratio of rotational to thermal energy.
	        if this ratio is > 0.25, the Hauser-Feshback formalism is 
	        used. Otherwise the Weisskopf formalism is used to get the
	        decay widths and choose the kinetic energy of the particle.
	        Then for this kinetic energy, the Hauser-Feshback formalism
 	        is used to get the orbital angular moment and spin of the 
	        residue. One can also use the function SetEvapMode to 
	        ensure only Hauser_feshback(iHF=1), only Weisskopf (iHF=0).
 	        For the Weisskopf part, I have also added a new classes 
	        to calculate inverse section CSigCharged and CSigBarDist.
	        The Hauser-Feshbach part has also been changed to speed it up.
	        The paramters of the residue nucleus are only calculated if 
	        that channel is selected. This involves storing more 
	        information and may be one down if the compter does have 
	        enough memory.
	        For 1 GeV spalation reactions, the default EvapMode
	        increase the speed by a factor of 6 to 8. For heavy-ion induced
	        fusion one may want to enforce the Hauser-Feshbach option.
25th Aug 2011   Davide 	Mancusi fround a minor memory leak.        
7th Sept 2011   The fade out of pairing was not consistent in Hauser-Feshbach
	        and Weisskopf calculations. Allows for calls to the 
	        leveldensity function with negative energy in the Weisskopf
	        calculations. The level density parameter is calculated with 
	        spin abs(fJ) and then the spin is ignored. This bug was found 
	        by Davide Mancusi. 
7th Nov 2011    Based on suggestion from Davide Mancusi extended isFission
	        function to two new functions
     	        isSymmetricFission - indicating a symmetric fission occurred
	        isAsymmetricFission - that an asymmetric fission occurred 
	                               in the decay
11th Nov 2011   extended transmisson coefficents function to work
	        for nuclei with Z up to 120.

2nd April 2012  a) force9B didn't assign parentage
	        b) light fragments call prepareAsyBarrier even when is 
	           was not possible for an IMF emission. Eric Bonnet helf
	           find this one
	        c) evaporation decay of excited 5Li,6Li,7Li, 5He which are 
	           notStatistical = false, left an excited alpha.
	           We now let all the excitation energy go into kinetic energy
	        These three changes were made to Nucleus.cpp
4th April 2012 force9B didn't assign times to products. fixed.	
5th April 2012 added the class History writtem by Davide Mancusi
10th April 2012 Davide Mancusi modified the code to remove some compiler 
	         warning on his computer	
23rd April 2012 a)added a sample heavy ion fusion main code to calculate so 
	        simple quentities. This should be easily expanded to suit
	        the needs of most users.
	        b)created a getZmaxEvap() function to return the max Z for 
	        evaporation. 

	        c)Fixed isSaddleToScission() function.

	        d)Now have tow origin parameters

	        origin = 0 then not from fission fragment or IMF
	        origin = 1 then saddle to scission
	        origin = 2 from light fission fragment or IMF
	        origin = 3 from heavy fission fragment or heavy 
	                   daughter after IMF emission

	        origin2 = 0 then not from a fission fragment
	        origin2 = 1 the saddle to scission
	        origin2 = 2 from light fission fragment
	        origin2 = 3 from heavy fission fragment

	        note in origin, fission and IMF emission are treated the same
	        whereas for origin2, evaporation and IMF emission are 
	        treated the same.

      	        e) introduced a EkFraction static variable in CNucleus 
	           to allow peaople to easily extent how far out in 
	           Ek they go, if you are trying to make EK spectra 
	
7th May 2012   a) the functions isResidue(), isSymmetricFission, and 
	       isAsymmetricFission() were not 
	       working. Needed to reset the logicals in the Reset function
	       b)stopped multiple calls to getCompoundNucleus which 
	       were not needed. might save a tiny little bit of time, 
	       but probably not important.

5th June 2012  modification to Run.cpp to remove uninteresting histograms 
	       and label the axies of existing histograms.
	       Incorporated Davide Mancusi modifications
	       associated with choosing the spin of the residual nucleus
	       in CNuclues:getSpin
	      
9th July 2012  documentation of Histrory calls added, and some other 
	       correction to avoid divide by zeros, etc, by Davide Mancusi
11th July 2012 Made sure there was no overlap in nuclei production 
	       between asymmetric fission and symmertic fission. Previously
	       for light nuclei we have both mechanisms producing the same
	       isotopes. To do this I stored the maximum Z for asymmetric 
	       fission (iZ1_IMF_Max). 
26th July 2012 added functions getFissionTimeSymmetric and 
	       getFissionTimeAsymmetric to give the saddle and scission times 
	       assocaited with symmetric and asymmetric fission. 
6th August 2012 The classes CEvap, CLevelDensity, CChart are now made to 
	       be singletons.
4th Sept 2012 The level density returned from getLogLevelDensitySpherical
	      was missing some constants. This was found by Cheng Lei.
	      These probably got lost in the conversion from fortran.
	      This is generally not a big deal as the decay 
	      widths are only sensitive to the relativel level density. 
	      But to be consistant I included these constants.
	      Also stopped the code crashing if k0 == kInfinity
4th October  for the "statistical" decay of Z=2+3 fragments 
	     if the decay did not occur, so no velocity was assigned 
	     to the final fragments. I noticed a few 6Li and 7Li 
	     fragments with zero velocity. Fixed this.
	     Noticed some strange artifacts form the TlBarDist code for 
	     protons in lighter nuclei. 
	     These are a result of bad extrapolations of the IWBC
	     transmission coefficents at large l when the barrier distrance 
	     is decreased. Until I find a better extrapolation, I have turned 
	     off barrier distributions for proton. Should not have a big 
	     effect.
8th Nov 2012 a)Created a CNucleus() constructor, i.e no arguements
	     b)The J-dependent level density was still used for the 
	     compound nucleus in the Weisskopf formalism. We now use a 
	     J-independent value
	     c) The code automatically switches to the high-ecitation energy
	        form of the level density above E/A=3, but if liitle 
	        is constant, i.e., aKappa = 0, then this level density 
	        prescription does not work, so in such cases we now 
	        use the low excitation-energy formalism
26th Nov 2012 A previous modification tried to restrict negative excitation 
	      energies, however these are possible during saddle to scission 
	      emission. so these were allowed again.
12th Feb 2013 Davide Mancusi made the storage arrays vectors, so we do not
	      have to worry about them overflowing the array length now.
	      Also made Run and RunThick a litle more elegant
26th Feb 2013 For convience I separated the getLittleA function into two parts
	      a) a getU() to determined the backshifted excitation energy
	      b) an extra getLittleA fuction with fewer arguements 
	         to determine the level density parameter. 
	      I also included an example code for alpha-induced reactions, 
	      where the initial compound-nucleus spin distribution comes from 
	      an optical-model calculation with the Avigeanu global 
	      parametrization. The OM code is included.
27th Mar 2013 The Qvalue in RunAlpha, was set to a fixed value for test, 
	      forget to delete this line and let the code calculate the Qvalue

21st Mar 2014 a) Made CRandom an instance 
	      b) alternatice CRandom class (in directory root2) that uses
	       the root TRandom3 class to generate the random numbers
	      c) Run.cpp and RunThick Z,A,N, spectra limits changed to reflect 
	          interger values
	      d) pairing energy redefine for N+Z old, 
	      e) in AsyFissionDivide, better subdivison of excitaion energy,
	         now proportional to rho1(E*)rho2(R*tot-E*)
2nd May 2014  a) While looking at the predicted odd-even effects I found
	         The Frinite-Range model had ood-evene effects in its 
	         shell corrctions. I have decide to try and wash these out,
	         at least as a function of N.
	         
17th June 2014 Whoops, only n and p evaporation decay modes were allowed,
	       This was put in to debug the last version and never taken out.
               Now its out.  Also applied EkFraction to Weisskopf formalism
	       so the Ek distribution for evaporation can be extented to 
	       larger values. 
12th July 2014 Implimented the changed to GEMINI by Michal Ciemala
	       Acta. Phys. Pol. B44 611 (2013) for gamma ray decay and a 
	       user defined GDR line shape. 
14th July 2014 Implimented new class CGdr to handle the Giant Dipole resonance
	       This readin the user-defined GDR parameters from the file
	       tbl/GDR.inp and calculated the GDR line shape from these 
	       parameters
15th Aug 2014  Modified Run.cpp to include some inclusive n,p,a kinetic energy
	       spectra, also corrected some mislabelling of axies in 
	       existing spectra. Added include <cstdlib> to CGdr.h
